relation between FPPG and AVG:

              aes(y = FPPG, # Set y-axis as insurance charges

       title = "FPPG and AVG")

g_4

#There is a positive correlation with a wide standard error. this shows that there is a correlation between AVG and fantasy points per game.
# Like the previous graph there is a lower correlation between the two variables than the previous year.
```
To conclude from our initial findings, The most broad offensive statistic has a correlation to fantasy points. However it is a slight positive relation. Our goal of this project is to see if we can predict what stats causes the player to set them apart from the rest of the players.
